  ContextOfStandard: "\rAt school and at home, students engage in step-by-step activities
    on a routine basis. These may include such activities as brushing their teeth
    or preparing to leave school at the end of the school day. When students document
    these step-by-step instructions they are creating algorithms. Sometimes there
    are repeating steps in a task, and students can create a loop in their algorithm
    to indicate that repeating pattern. Algorithms can be created with or without
    computers. In first grade the students are introduced to the use of loops, in
    second grade this understanding expands to include repeating patterns and growing
    patterns. In second grade, the construction of loops becomes more complex as
    students use a wide variety of patterns to include repeating and growing patterns.
    In a repeating pattern the units of the pattern repeat and remain the same. In
    a growing pattern, an addition is added to the pattern causing the pattern to
    change every time it repeats. Growing patterns involve a progression from step
    to step which make them more difficult for students than repeating patterns.
    Repeating and growing patterns are foundational in mathematics in the development
    of algebraic reasoning and in computer science in developing computational thinking."
