  Objective: The st udent will identify and create strong passwords, explain why
    strong passwords should be used. (e.g. protect name, address, and telephone number)
  SubObjectives: []
  ContextOfStandard: "Connecting devices to a network or the Internet provides great
    benefit, but care must be taken to protect private information such as a student\u2019s
    name, phone number, and address. Passwords are used to protect devices and information
    from unauthorized access. Because computer programs can be used to guess passwords,
    strong passwords have characteristics that make them more difficult to guess.
    Many sites have rules as to the length and composition of passwords; these rules
    help create stronger passwords. The practice of not sharing passwords should
    be emphasized in the classroom and at home. At the elementary level, students
    are encouraged to use passwords. These passwords may not be as complex as those
    used by adults in protecting information. Suggestions for creating strong passwords
    for students include: \n1.) Use uppercase and loercase letters\n2.) Use numbers\n3.)
    Use symbols\n4.) Use at least 8 characters\n5.) Don't use words from a dictionary\n6.)
    Don't use the same password twice\n7.) Don't use personal information"
