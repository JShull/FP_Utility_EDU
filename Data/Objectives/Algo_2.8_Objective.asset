  Objective: The student will identify, using accurate terminology, simple hardware
    and software problems that may occur during use (e.g. app or program not working
    as expected, no sound, device won't turn on.)
  SubObjectives: []
  ContextOfStandard: Although computing systems may vary, common troubleshooting
    strategies can be used on them, such as checking connections and power or swapping
    a working part in place of a potentially defective part. Rebooting a machine
    is commonly effective because it resets the computer. Since computing devices
    are composed of an interconnected system of hardware and software, troubleshooting
    strategies may need to address both. Students in second grade are expected to
    use accurate terminology to describe simple problems with computer hardware and
    software.
