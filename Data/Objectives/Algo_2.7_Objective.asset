  Objective: The student will describe the characteristics of computing systems to
    include hardware, software, input, and output.
  SubObjectives: []
  ContextOfStandard: A system is defined as a regularly interacting or interdependent
    group of items forming a unified whole. A computing system is composed of hardware
    and software. Hardware consists of physical components, while software provides
    instructions for the system. These instructions are represented in a form that
    a computer can understand and allow the user to input information and, once the
    task is completed, obtain output in a form that can be understood. Hardware and
    software work together as a system to accomplish tasks, such as sending, receiving,
    processing, and storing units of information. Hardware devices include screens
    to display information and buttons, keys, or touch screens to enter information.
    Software applications are programs with specific purposes, such as a web browser
    or game. A person may use a mouse (hardware) to click on a button displayed in
    a web browser (software) to navigate to a new web page.
