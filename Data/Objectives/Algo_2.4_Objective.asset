  Objective: The student will plan and create a design document to illustrate thoughts,
    ideas, and stories in a sequential (step-by-step) manner (e.g. story map, storyboard,
    sequential graphic organizer)
  SubObjectives: []
  ContextOfStandard: As students write and tell stories, they use tools such as story
    maps, storyboards, and sequential graphic organizers to plan and describe events.
    In second grade, planning stories becomes more complex as they begin to add descriptive
    details to their stories. Planning a story is similar to writing an algorithm
    or program in that there are steps that are followed as the author determines
    the beginning, middle and end of the story as well as adds details to accomplish
    a task. Just as there are multiple ways to tell a story, different algorithms
    can be used to describe a task. While the end results may be similar, the actual
    pathway to achieve the task may not be the same. This standard is intended to
    develop a fundamental understanding that programs can be developed using similar
    strategies as stories
