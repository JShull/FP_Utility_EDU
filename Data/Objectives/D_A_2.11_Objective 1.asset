  Objective: 'The student will construct and analyze data and organize it in a chart

    or
    graph in order to make a prediction, with or without a computing device.'
  SubObjectives: []
  ContextOfStandard: "The collection and use of data about individuals and the world
    around them is a routine part of life and influences how people live.Data are
    pieces of information collected about people or things. These data can be recorded
    in tables and can be used to construct pictographs or bar graphs. Everyday digital
    devices can be used to collect and display data over time. Examples include cell
    phones, digital toys, and cars. These can contain tools (such as sensors) and
    computers to collect and display data from their surrounding. \nOnce data has
    been collected and organized into a chart or graph, it can be analyzed to determine
    if a pattern exists. The pattern can be used to make predictions or answer questions"
