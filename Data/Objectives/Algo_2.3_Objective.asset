  Objective: The student will analyze, correct, and improve (debug) an algorithm
    that includes sequencing and simple loops, with or without a computing device
  SubObjectives: []
  ContextOfStandard: The practice of reviewing work should be taught early and can
    be applied across disciplines, including computer science. Students should check
    that the sequence of steps that compose an algorithm works as intended. That
    is the only way to determine if the algorithm appropriately reflects the steps
    that must occur to complete a task. This process can be conducted for both computer
    programs and unplugged activities. If the algorithm does not work as intended,
    the students should determine the changes to make in the algorithm in order to
    complete the task. These changes may include adding, deleting, rearranging, or
    changing a step in order to obtain the intended outcome. The process of revising
    a program so that it works as intended is called debugging.
