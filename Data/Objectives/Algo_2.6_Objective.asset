  Objective: The student will acknowledge that materials are created by others (e.g.
    author, illustrator, and website)
  SubObjectives: []
  ContextOfStandard: As students start to work with different artifacts (reference
    materials, resources, etc.) they should understand that these sources of information
    were created by others. Authors, illustrators, and programmers are responsible
    for the creation of many sources of information that are used in the classroom
    and at home. This standard begins an exploration of the concepts of intellectual
    property laws and plagiarism. Students are not responsible for the terms property
    laws and plagiarism in second grade.
