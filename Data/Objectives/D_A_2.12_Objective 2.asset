  Objective: The student will create a model of a physical object or process in order
    to show relationships with or without a computing device (e.g., water cycle,
    butterfly life cycle, seasonal weather patterns).
  SubObjectives: []
  ContextOfStandard: 'Scientists, computer scientists, mathematicians, and programmers
    construct and use models to better conceptualize and understand

    phenomena
    under investigation or to develop a possible solution to a proposed problem.
    Models include diagrams, physical replicas,

    mathematical representations,
    analogies, and computer simulations. Models are used to represent a system (or
    parts of a system)

    under study, to aid in the development of questions and
    explanations, to generate data that can be used to make predictions, and to

    communicate
    ideas to others. In second grade, students are expected to create simple models.
    These models may be created using a computing device.'
