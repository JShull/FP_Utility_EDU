  SubObjectives: []
  ContextOfStandard: "People have always used devices to assist in computation. They
    can help in the collection, storage, or manipulation of data. Early computers
    used mechanical components to perform calculations. In the early 1800s, the first
    programmable computers were created. They were limited in their capability, and
    relied heavily on people to do more complex computation. \r\n\r\nThese people
    were referred to as computers due to their similar role. Many of these computers
    were women who were employed in commerce, government, military, and research
    establishments.  The development of computing technology has expanded exponentially
    over the past 100 years. The development and modification of computing technology
    is driven by people\u2019s needs and wants. Computing technologies influence,
    and are influenced by, cultural practices."
