  Objective: The student will explain what is allowed and what is not allowed at
    school associated with the use of technology (e.g., class rules)
  SubObjectives: []
  ContextOfStandard: Computer networks, including the Internet, can be used to connect
    people to other people, places, information, and ideas. In order to keep students
    safe, schools and divisions have rules on the appropriate use of technology.
    All students should be aware of what is allowed and not allowed when using division/school
    technology. Appropriate use of technology as well as school and division rules
    when using technology should be reviewed with students on a regular basis. Consistent
    monitoring of students when engaged with technology should be conducted at all
    times.
