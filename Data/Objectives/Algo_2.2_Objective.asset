  Objective: The student will construct programs to accomplish tasks as a means of
    creativie expression using a block-based programming language or unplugged activities,
    both independently and collaboratively

  ContextOfStandard: When an algorithm or a set of algorithms is tested, a program
    has been created. People work together to plan, create and test these programs.
    This process of planning, creating, and testing a program or algorithm is called
    programming and is used to create a wide variety of products such as video games,
    interactive art projects and digital stories. In second grade, students are expected
    to develop simple programs that use both sequencing and simple loops to complete
    a task. These programs may be developed using block-based or unplugged activities.
    Block-based programs (e.g., Scratch Jr., Tynker) allow students to develop simple
    algorithms using a computer. Students are also expected to identify events; an
    event is an action or occurrence detected by a program.
