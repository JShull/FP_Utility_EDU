  Objective: The student will compare and contrast a group of items based on the
    attributes or actions of each item, with or without a computing device.
  SubObjectives: []
  ContextOfStandard: Objects and actions have attributes; these attributes allow
    people to group items. Attributes may be physical properties, behaviors, or actions.
    Actions in computer science are reflected in step-by-step sequences (algorithms).
    Actions may include back and forth movement, turning, and stopping. Categorizing
    of attributes or actions relies on careful observation of patterns and similarities
    and differences. In this standard, students are expected to analyze groups of
    items and compare and contrast the attributes that led to the development of
    the group. In block-based programming environments, commands are grouped into
    categories based on function. In higher level programming languages, data are
    often classified by the type and format of the information.
